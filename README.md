# ThirtyMinutesChallenges

My workplace says I need to relax for 30 minutos everyday. My brain feels the most relaxed when I'm coding. So I'm declaring ThirtyMinutesChallenges as my new relaxing activity during 30 minutes everyday as I'm learning the ways of the code.

## Rules

One commit per day every weekday.

No deadlines or milestones.

Each creation says within it's own branch up until deployment day (when project is finished).

Creations can be both mine or based on others (see acknowledgements section for credits).

Have fun.
